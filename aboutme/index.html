    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Alfredo Ritta</h2>
    <h2>I do not have a nick-name but I am known for taking naps.</h2>
    <p>I do like to take naps when ever possible. I have about a year of school left and I can't wait for it to be over ha!</p>
    <p>My degree is in IT, and I do work in IT so it's a perfect match. My role is mostly backend, so this web class is good for me. 
        <p>I have a hobby <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pennypresser/#">link</a>
        and I used to post about it. I haven't lately, because I forgot the password and now I'm locked out.</p>
